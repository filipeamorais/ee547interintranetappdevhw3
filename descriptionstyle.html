        <h1>Description of Style 1</h1>

        <p>Before this class I started one online course about css and through there I had created a style sheet. So I used that style as a base for this homework.</p>
        <p>First of all I reset the default style from the browser that sets some standards styles to the page using the css normalize. Then I selected one serifed font-family for the body and san-serifed font-family for the h1 and h2 tags. I used 3 differents collors for the page: white, black and red. And also one modification that improved a lot the design of the page, in my opinion, was adding the padding, which is the space from the borders, and centering the whole main division with the attribute margin auto.</p>
