        <h1>Outstanding web pages</h1>

        <p>I did some researches about web pages and I found a competion that awards the best ones, so I chose 3 withing the winners.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/">Signup Genius</a></h2>

        <p>It is a very responsive web page with not much crowded information and good text descriptions.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.surfcityusa.com/">Surf City USA</a></h2>

        <p>A very responsive web page as well, full of pictures, big texts and very good art design.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.acurrygirl.com/">A Curry Girls</a></h2>

        <p>Clean design what makes it good for reading since it is a blog. Side bar that is fixed and very good choice of the font.</p>
