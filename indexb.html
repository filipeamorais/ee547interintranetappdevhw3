        <h1>Filipe Morais</h1>

        <p>I am 29 years old, Brazilian, electrical engineer and I moved to Alabama on January 2019. I was born in 1989 and my parents raised me together with my younger sister. Mostly of the time we lived in São Bernardo, a city of the state of São Paulo, but we have always traveled a lot and maybe that is one of the reasons that I learned to enjoy traveling, descovering new places and meeting new people. </p>

        <p>After finishing my master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UAB, I plan to get a job and earn some experience here at the US before returning to Brazil.</p>
