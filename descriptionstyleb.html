        <h1>Description of Style 2</h1>

        <p>The changes I applied to the second style were the background color for the body, increase the font size, the main h1 background color to green, removed the margin auto from the main div and also changed the color of the paragraph font to white.</p>
        <p>Just the changing of the background and font color I would think on keeping because I believe dark colors are less stressy to the eyes. For all the others I believe the initial style sheet is better.</p>
